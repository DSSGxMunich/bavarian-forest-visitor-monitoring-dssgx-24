# Project Background and Goal

The Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany's oldest national park, is a major tourist destination, attracting over 1.4 million visitors annually. However, its popularity brings logistical challenges. Accurately forecasting, managing, and controlling tourist flows is essential to maintain sustainable tourism and conserve natural resources.

Although significant data on tourist flows is collected in and around the park, the data is highly diverse and stored in various formats. Further automation is necessary to process and integrate these data sources, ensuring seamless information flow.

The project's goal is to aid different stakeholders by integrating and disseminating information about tourist flows in the Bavarian Forest National Park.

# Our Impact

The projectâ€™s success will enhance information flow to various stakeholders, contributing to more sustainable resource management, including reducing humman impact on the Bavarian Forest and surrounding area.
