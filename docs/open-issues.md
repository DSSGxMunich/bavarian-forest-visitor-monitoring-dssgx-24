# Open Issues

During the course of the project, we had some ideas and approaches that we were unable to tackle due to time constraints and had to declare “out of scope”.

We have documented these as **issues in our public git repository**.

If you want to take a look at them, see [here](https://github.com/DSSGxMunich/bavarian-forest-visitor-monitoring-dssgx-24/issues).
