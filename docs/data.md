# Step 1: Data Sourcing

**In this section, we will describe the data sources used and how they can be sourced.**

### Sensor Data for Visitor Counts

The visitor sensor data is an internal 
administrative file maintained by the Bavarian Forest National Park. 
The park has over 700 entry and exit points, of which 26 are equipped
with pyro sensors designed to detect the flow of visitors. These 
sensors can distinguish the direction in which visitors are traveling, 
counting each person entering or exiting the park. When a visitor 
enters, the sensor increments a count of 1 to the sensor-specific “IN” 
column in the data file, and similarly, when a visitor exits, it 
increments a count of 1 to the corresponding “OUT” column. This 
system allows for the tracking of visitor movement throughout the 
park. In addition to this, some sensors, referred to as "multi-sensors," 
are capable of distinguishing between cyclists and pedestrians, 
providing more detailed visitor data. Furthermore, while some sensors
can automatically upload their data to the Bayern Cloud, others 
require manual uploads through on-site data collection using a USB 
drive.

### Visitor Center Data

The visitor center data file is an internal 
administrative data file maintained by the Bavarian Forest National 
Park. This data file includes daily counts of visitors to the various 
visitor centers (add the types of visitor centers) as well as columns 
that indicate whether or not the visitor center was open or closed on a
given day. Additionally, temporal-related information is kept in this 
administrative file, including whether or not a given day was a federal
or national holiday (Bavarian or Czech; School or Federal or School 
holiday), the season, the day of the week, and date.

### Weather Data

Historical and forecasted weather data was sourced 
using the Meteostat Python API, a powerful library that provides 
access to a comprehensive database of weather and climate 
information. This library allows users to retrieve data for specific 
locations worldwide. For our analysis, we obtained hourly historical 
and forecasted weather data for the Haselbach region, with specific 
coordinates of Latitude = 49.31452390542327 and Longitude = 
12.711573421032. Our analysis focused on several key variables, 
including wind speed (km/h), relative humidity (%), and temperature 
(Celsius). Additionally, we included a categorical variable that 
classifies the weather conditions at each hour into 27 levels, 
encompassing conditions such as sunny, fair, rain, heavy rain, cloudy, 
hail, and more. CoCo, which stands for weather “Condition Code," is 
the shorthand used by Meteostat to classify various weather 
conditions. Below is a table that outlines all levels of CoCo and how 
we recoded them for easier interpretation: 

| Original CoCo Codes | Original CoCo Weather Description                               | Recoded CoCo Code & New Weather Description |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1, 2                 | Clear, Fair                                                      | 1 (Sunny)                                   |
| 3, 4, 5              | Cloudy, Overcast, Fog                                           | 2 (Clouds)                                  |
| 7, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19  | Light Rain, Rain, Heavy Rain, Rain Shower, Heavy Rain Shower, Sleet Shower | 3 (Rainy)                                   |
| 14, 15, 16, 21, 22   | Light Snowfall, Snowfall, Heavy Snowfall, Snow Shower, Heavy Snow Shower | 4 (Snow)                                    |
| 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20| Freezing Fog, Freezing Rain, Heavy Freezing Rain, Sleet, Heavy Sleet, Heavy Sleet Shower | 5 (Extreme Weather)                          |
| 23, 24, 25, 26, 27   | Lightning, Hail, Thunderstorm, Heavy Thunderstorm, Storm       | 6 (Storms)                                  |


### Parking Data

Historical and real-time parking data for the Bavarian 
Forest National Park is sourced from the Bayern Cloud, a cloud 
computing service provided by the Bavarian government to support 
public administration, municipalities, and other organizations in the 
region. The park has 12 sensors installed in its parking lots, which 
monitor the occupancy of parking spaces. These sensors provide data 
on each lot's capacity, current occupancy, and occupancy rate. 
However, two of the parking lot sensors are currently offline, so data 
from those locations is unavailable. The frequency at which the 
sensors transmit data to the Bayern Cloud varies, both across 
different sensors and within individual sensors over time.
