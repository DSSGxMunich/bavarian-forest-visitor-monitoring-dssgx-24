# Project Background, Mission, and Impact

### Background
The Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany's oldest national park, is a hotspot for European flora and fauna. It is also a major tourist destination, attracting over 1.4 million visitors annually. 

**Harmonizing** these two sides, that is the **least-possible disturbance to nature with positive visitor experiences**, is one of the biggest challenges of the Bavarian Forest National Park Administration.

Accurately forecasting, managing, and controlling tourist flows is essential to maintain sustainable tourism and conserve natural resources.

Although significant data on tourist flows is collected in and around the park, this data has so far only been used to a limited extent. The data is highly diverse and stored in various formats. Further automation is necessary to process and integrate these data sources, ensuring seamless information flows.

### Mission
The project's mission is to **transform these data into actionable insights** by developing a **prediction model for visitor flows** and a dashboard to display key information.

### Impact
The projectâ€™s success will enhance information flow to various stakeholders, contributing to more sustainable resource management, including reducing humman impact on the Bavarian Forest and surrounding area.
